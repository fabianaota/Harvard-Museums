        In 1912, Langdon Warner taught the first courses in Asian art at Harvard, and the first at
        any American university.

        By 1977, Harvardâ€™s collections of Asian, ancient, and Islamic and later Indian art had grown
        sufficiently in size and importance to require a larger space for their display and study.

        With the generosity of Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, a leading psychiatrist, entrepreneur, art
        collector, and philanthropist, the Harvard Art Museums founded a museum dedicated to works
        from Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.

        The Arthur M. Sackler Museum, a new museum building at 485 Broadway designed by James Stirling,
        opened in 1985.

        This structure remains the home of the History of Art and Architecture Department and the
        Media Slide Library.
